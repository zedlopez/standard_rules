"The Big Sainsbury's"

Sainsbury's is a room.

The crispy duck and the Guinness steak pie are edible things in Sainsbury's.

Rule for implicitly taking something:
	follow the advance time rule;
	continue the activity.

When play begins:
	now the right hand status line is "[time of day]".

Test me with "take crispy duck / eat crispy duck / eat steak pie".
