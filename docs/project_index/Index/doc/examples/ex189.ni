 "IQ Test"

The Donut Shop is a room. "Vibrantly decorated in donut colors: pink, brown, and cream."

Ogg is a man in the Donut Shop. "Ogg is slumped in the corner[if Ogg carries something] with [a list of things carried by Ogg][end if]. He wears a nametag which says 'HELLO MY NAME IS OG.'" Understand "og" as Ogg. Ogg wears a nametag. The description of the nametag is "Sadly misspelled."

The Donut Shop contains a transparent closed openable locked lockable container called a case. The case contains some cake donuts. The donuts are edible.

The matching key of the case is a silver key. The silver key is carried by Ogg.

A persuasion rule for asking someone to try doing something:
	persuasion succeeds.

Before someone opening a locked thing (called the sealed chest):
	if the person asked is carrying the matching key of the sealed chest, try the person asked unlocking the sealed chest with the matching key of the sealed chest;
	if the sealed chest is locked, stop the action.

Before someone taking something which is in a closed container (called the shut chest):
	try the person asked opening the shut chest;
	if the shut chest is closed, stop the action.

The block giving rule is not listed in the check giving it to rules.

Test me with "open case / get donuts / og, get donuts / og, give me the donuts / eat donuts".
