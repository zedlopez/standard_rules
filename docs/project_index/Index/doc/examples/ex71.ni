"Fifty Ways to Leave Your Larva"

The Beekeeper's Palace is a room. Wasp is a woman in the palace. Drone is a man in the palace.

Instead of kissing someone:
	say "'[denial], [insult]! [boast]!'";

[In this context, [denial] is understood to refer to the denial property of the noun -- but we could spell it out with "denial of the noun" if we wanted to.]

A person has some text called denial. The denial of a person is usually "Stand back". The denial of Drone is "You forget yourself"

A person has some text called  insult. The insult of a person is usually "Grasshopper". The insult of Wasp is "Larva".

A person has some text called  boast. The boast of a person is usually "I am ferocious". The boast of Drone is "I have ferocious allies".

[And then it would be trivial to insert further rules using these responses:]

Instead of attacking someone:
	say "'Get away, [insult]!'"

Test me with "kiss wasp / hit wasp / hit drone / kiss drone".
