There are holes in the roof, and in the winter the snow comes in -- rain, too, for that matter. The walls aren&#39;t very well-boarded, and don&#39;t keep out the wind, and even though you live in the middle of dense woods, you can never gather enough fuel to keep this place fully heated. And then there&#39;s the stench. Pigs wander freely in and out, and your three youngest brothers play on the floor.&quot;</span></span><br></span>

The description is <span class="i7sx">&quot;They really are very grubby, dirty animals, but what&#39;s worse than that, the value of pigs has declined a lot over the last few decades. This is hard to explain to someone who has been out of touch with the world for a while, but keeping pigs for meat is a dubious prospect when there&#39;s less and less for them to forage on.&quot;</span> Instead of smelling the pigs: say <span class="i7sx">&quot;They smell the way animals do, when they live among their own refuse.&quot;</span>; increase the pity of Beauty by 2.</span><br></span>
