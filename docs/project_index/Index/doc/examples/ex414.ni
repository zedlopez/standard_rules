 "Alpha"

When play begins:
	say "Hi, Larry! Thanks for testing my game!!"

Unimplemented Room is a room. "Room description goes here..."

The scary troll is a man in Unimplemented Room.

After reading a command (this is the ignore beta-comments rule):
	if the player's command matches the regular expression "^\p":
		say "(Noted.)";
		reject the player's command.

Test me with "x me / x troll / !this game is a bit dull so far / kiss troll / ? does this troll do anything? / :yawn".
