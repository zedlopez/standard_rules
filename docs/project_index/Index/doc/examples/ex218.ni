"Flashlight"

The Schoolhouse is a room. "Though normally comfortable, the room is dark and menacing during the storm; rain sheets on the windows, and you can barely see the flash of the lighthouse only a few miles away."

The cabinet is a fixed in place openable container in the Schoolhouse. The hurricane lantern is a thing in the Schoolhouse. "A hurricane lantern hangs from a peg." The lantern is lit.

Visibility rule when looking under something:
	if the player is carrying a lit thing (called lamp):
		say "You shine [the lamp] under [the noun]...";
		there is sufficient light;
	there is insufficient light.

There is a marble. The marble can be found or lost. The marble is lost.

Instead of looking under the cabinet when the marble is lost:
	move the marble to the player;
	now the marble is found;
	say "Billy's lost marble! So that's where it got to!"

Test me with "look under cabinet / get lantern / look under cabinet".
