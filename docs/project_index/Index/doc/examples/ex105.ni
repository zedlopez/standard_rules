 "Mattress King"

Monica's Bedroom is a room. The Living Room is south of Monica's Bedroom. Rachel's Bedroom is south of the Living Room.

After going a direction (called way-pushed) with something (called the thing-pushed):
	say "You push [the thing-pushed] [way-pushed] to [the location].";
	continue the action.

The race car bed is an enterable supporter in Monica's Bedroom. It is pushable between rooms.

Test me with "push bed south".
