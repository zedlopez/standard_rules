Wide Open Field is a room. "A big field under a big sky. The clouds are puffy, the trees are handsome."

Some clouds and some trees are scenery in Wide Open Field. The description of the clouds is "That one looks like Yoda's head." The description of the trees is "You've never been much good at botany, so it's anyone's guess what kind they are."

A rock is in Wide Open Field. The description of the rock is "It looks like it's been here from the dawn of time."

The broken flower pot is a thing. The description of the broken flower pot is "It contains the remains of some abused petunias."

At 9:01 am:
	move the broken flower pot to the location;
	say "Quite unexpectedly, a flower pot falls from the sky and breaks open on the ground. Good thing you weren't standing six inches to the left.";
	set pronouns from the broken flower pot.

Test me with "x it / x it / x it".
