"Uptempo"

The fast time rule is listed instead of the advance time rule in the turn sequence rules.

This is the fast time rule:
	increment the turn count;
	increase the time of day by 15 minutes.

When play begins: now the right hand status line is "[time of day]".

The Temporal Hot Spot is a room.

Test me with "z / z".
