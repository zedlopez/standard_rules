"Zero"

Weight is a kind of value. The weights are light, manageable, and horribly heavy. Everything has a weight.

A thing is usually manageable.

[This does require a rule for an activity (see the chapter on Activities), but it's a fairly straightforward one:]

Before printing the name of a horribly heavy thing (called weighty object):
	if we have taken the weighty object, say "[weight] ".

The Nearly Empty Living Room is a room. "Nearly everything is out, all of Helen's possessions and most of yours." A man called Mr Zero is in the Nearly Empty Living Room. "Mr Zero, despite being heavily paid to assist in this operation, is giving you a look that clearly conveys his lack of interest in budging even one more item." The description of Mr Zero is "Many muscles, no hair."

The book box is a horribly heavy thing in the Living Room. The clothing box is a manageable thing in the Living Room. A broom, a dustpan, some packing tape, and a discarded newspaper are light things in the Living Room.

After taking a horribly heavy thing:
	say "Taken. (Oof.)"

Test me with "get clothing / look / get book box / look / i / drop book box / look".
