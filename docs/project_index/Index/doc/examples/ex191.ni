"Red Cross"

Diagnosing is an action applying to one visible thing. Understand "diagnose [something]" as diagnosing.

Check diagnosing:
	if the noun is not a person, say "Only people can have diagnoses." instead.

Carry out diagnosing:
	say "You're not a medical expert."

Instead of diagnosing the player:
	say "You feel fine!"

The Clinic is a room. Fred is a man in the Clinic. The player carries a tongue-depressor.

Test me with "diagnose me / diagnose fred / diagnose tongue-depressor".
