"Wesponses"

The Office is a room. Barry Kripke is a man in the Office.

The response inhibition is initially false.

Rule for issuing the response text of a response (called R) when response inhibition is false:
	now response inhibition is true;
	let output be "[text of R]";
	now response inhibition is false;
	replace the text "r" in output with "w";
	replace the text "R" in output with "W";
	say "[output]".

Test me with "i / x barry / listen / waffle / jump"
