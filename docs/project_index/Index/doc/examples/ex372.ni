"Minimal Movement"

The Doll-like House is a room. The Postage-Stamp-Sized Garden is outside from the House.

Rule for supplying a missing noun while going:
	now noun is outside.

[This particular situation is very slightly complicated by the existing rules about vague movement, but fortunately we can easily turn those off.]

The block vaguely going rule is not listed in the for supplying a missing noun rules.

Test me with "go".
