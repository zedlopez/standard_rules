"Puncak Jaya"

A ghost is a kind of person. A man-ghost is a kind of ghost. A man-ghost is always male. A woman-ghost is a kind of ghost. A woman-ghost is always female.

[We make the ghost a person rather than some other kind of thing so that it will be able to respond to commands such as KISS BOB or (even trickier) BOB, JUMP: if Inform did not recognize the ghost as an animate creature, it would not accept such input.]

Representation relates one ghost to one person. The verb to represent means the representation relation.

One man-ghost represents every man. One woman-ghost represents every woman.

[This is, technically, an assembly -- except instead of saying that every device has a button part, or that there are three daffodils in every garden room, the assembly is based on a non-physical relation that we just designed.]

[Based on the "representation" relation, we now devise a conditional relation that applies only when the represented thing is not itself in view:]

Indication relates a ghost (called X) to a person (called Y) when X represents Y and Y is not visible.

Understand "[something related by indication]" as a ghost.

When play begins:
	now every ghost is in the concept-repository.

Instead of doing something to a ghost:
	say "You seem to have left [a random person which is represented by the noun] behind."

Instead of doing something when the second noun is a ghost:
	say "You seem to have left [a random person which is represented by the second noun] behind."

The concept-repository is an open unopenable transparent container. It is part of the air. The air is a backdrop. It is everywhere.

Base of Puncak Jaya is a room. Temple, Kippax, and Huizenga are men in Base. Peak of Puncak Jaya is above Base of Puncak Jaya.

Test me with "x kippax / up / x kippax / kiss kippax / kippax, hello".
