"Virtue"

The Cloister is a room. Lady Teresa is a woman in the Cloister. Mother Margaret is a woman in the Cloister.

Attacking someone is misbehavior. Kissing someone is misbehavior.

Instead of asking someone to try misbehavior: say "[The person asked] stiffens, offended by your suggestion."

Test me with "kiss margaret / margaret, kiss me".
