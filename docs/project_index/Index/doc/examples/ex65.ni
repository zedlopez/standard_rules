"Whence?"

The temporal vortex is an open door. It is west of Yesterday and east of Today.

The initial appearance of a door is usually "Nearby [an item described] leads [if the other side of the item described is visited][direction of the item described from the location] to [the other side][otherwise][direction of the item described from the location][end if]."

Test me with "w / e".
