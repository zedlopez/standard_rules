"Grilling"

The Patio is a room. The Patio contains a grill and an ice chest. The ice chest contains a cold beer. On the grill are a steak and a hot dog.

Mom is a woman in the Patio.

Instead of taking something which is on the grill:
	say "'Hey, you'll burn yourself,' says Mom."

Test me with "get steak / get all from grill / get all".
