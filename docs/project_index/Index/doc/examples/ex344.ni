"Unpeeled"

Scullery is a room. A sack is carried by the player. The sack contains a yellow onion. The player carries a cork.

Before printing the name of the onion while listing contents:
	if the holder of the onion contains exactly 1 thing, say "single ".

Test me with "i / put cork in sack / i".
