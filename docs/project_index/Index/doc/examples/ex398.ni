"Access All Areas"

The extremely difficult door is north of the Standing Room and south of the Room of Walking Upside Down.  It is a locked door.

The player is carrying the Pointy Hat of Liminal Transgression. The hat is wearable.

The can't go through closed doors rule does nothing when the Hat is worn.

Test me with "n / wear hat / n".
