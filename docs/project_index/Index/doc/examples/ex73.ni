"Finishing School"

The apple is an edible thing carried by the player.

The Hall is a room. Miss Wicket is a woman in the Hall.

The Dormitory is south of the Hall.

Definition: a person is another if it is not the player.

Instead of eating something in the presence of another person:
	say "Your mannerly upbringing prevents you from eating without a fork or knife in front of someone."

Test me with "eat apple / south / eat apple".
