"Fallout Enclosure"

Section 1 - Procedure

An enclosure is a kind of thing. A container is a kind of enclosure. A supporter is a kind of enclosure.

Understand "zap [something]" as zapping. Zapping is an action applying to one thing. The Zapping action has a list of things called the remnants.

Carry out zapping an enclosure:
	if the noun holds something:
		now the remnants is the list of things held by the noun;
		repeat with N running through the remnants:
			move N to the holder of the noun.

Carry out zapping:
	now the noun is nowhere.

Report zapping:
	say "You zap [the noun], destroying [them][if the remnants is not empty] and leaving [the remnants with indefinite articles] behind[end if]."

Section 2 - Scenario

The shelves support a bottle of Buffout and a container of Jet.
