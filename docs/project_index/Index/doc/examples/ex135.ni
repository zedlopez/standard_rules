"Clueless"

The murderer is a person that varies.

When play begins:
	now the murderer is a random person who is not the player.

The Billiards Room is a room. Colonel Mustard and Professor Plum are men in the Billiards Room. Miss Scarlet and Mrs White are women in the Billiards Room.

Instead of examining the murderer:
	say "[The noun] certainly looks fiendish!"

Test me with "x mustard / x plum / x scarlet / x white".
