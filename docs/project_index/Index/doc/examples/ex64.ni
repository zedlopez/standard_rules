"Persephone"

Instead of taking inventory:
	say "[if the player carries something][We]['re] carrying [a list of things carried by the player][otherwise][We]['re] empty-handed";
	say "[if the player wears something]. [We]['re] wearing [a list of things worn by the player][end if]."

The Fancy Party is a room. The player carries a sword, a strawberry stem, and 20 credits worth of platinum. The player wears a sash indicating lordhood.

Test me with "i / take off sash / i / drop all / i".
