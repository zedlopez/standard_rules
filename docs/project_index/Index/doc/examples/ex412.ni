"Capital City"

Capital City is a room. East is Lower Caissons. South of Lower Caissons
is San Seriffe. East of San Seriffe is a dark room.

To say the player's capitalised surroundings:
	let the masthead be "[the player's surroundings]" in upper case;
	say the masthead.

When play begins:
	now the left hand status line is "[the player's capitalised surroundings]".

Test me with "e / s / e".
