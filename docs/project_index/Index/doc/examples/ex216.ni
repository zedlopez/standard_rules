"Waterworld 1"

A view is a kind of backdrop. Instead of doing something other than examining to a view, say "You are too far from [the noun] to do anything but look."

The sun is a view. It is everywhere. The description is "A blazing sun makes you wish you had never been born."

The Sahara is a room. North of the Sahara is More Sahara. North of More Sahara is Yet Further Sahara.

Test me with "x sun / get sun / n / x sun / n / x sun".
