"Bikini Atoll" by Edward Teller

The Hut and the Tropical Beach are rooms.

The conch shell is in the Hut. After taking the shell for the first time: say "As you gather the oddly-warm conch shell into your arms, you experience a sudden flash of deja-vu...[banner text]"; move the player to the Tropical Beach.

Rule for printing the banner text when the player is not carrying the shell: do nothing.

Test me with "look / examine shell / get shell / look".
