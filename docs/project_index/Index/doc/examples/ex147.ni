"Night Sky"

The Planetarium is a room. "[if we have examined the sinister message]A dark room where it seems something is about to jump out at you![otherwise]A tranquil dark room with a ceilingful of stars.[end if]"

The sinister message is a thing in the Planetarium. "A message is taped to the wall." The description is "'BEWARE.'"

Test me with "look / x message / look".
