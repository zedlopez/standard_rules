"Situation Room"

The Situation Room is a room.

To say (relevant time - a time) as 24h time:
	let H be the hours part of relevant time;
	let M be the minutes part of relevant time;
	say "[if H is less than 10]0[end if][H][if M is less than 10]0[end if][M]".

When play begins:
	now the time of day is 6:09 PM;
	now the right hand status line is "[time of day as 24h time]".

Test me with "z".
