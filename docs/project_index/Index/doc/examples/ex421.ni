 "Blackout"

Tiny Room is a dark room. Absurdly Long-Named Room is a dark room. It is west of Tiny Room.

The Candle Factory is north of Tiny Room. It contains a beeswax candle. The beeswax candle is lit.

Rule for printing the name of a dark room:
	let N be "[location]";
	replace the regular expression "\w" in N with "*";
	say "[N]".

Test me with "w / look / e / n / get candle / s / w".
