"The Trouble with Printing"

A thing has some text called printing. The printing of a thing is usually "blank".

Understand the command "read" as something new. Understand "read [something]" as reading. Reading is an action applying to one thing, requiring light. Check reading: if the printing of the noun is "blank", say "Nothing is written on [the noun]." instead. Carry out reading: say "You read: [printing of the noun][line break]". Report reading: do nothing.

The Archive is a room.

Berkeley's report is a thing in the Archive. The description is "A report from Governor Sir William Berkeley of Virginia, in 1671, in answer to the queries sent by the Commissioners of Plantations the year previous. Of this report the better part is burned and only a tail fragment remains." The printing of Berkeley's report is "I thank God, [italic type]there are no free schools[roman type] nor [italic type]printing[roman type], and I hope we shall not have these hundred years; for [italic type]learning[roman type] has brought disobedience, and heresy, and sects into the world, and [italic type]printing[roman type] has divulged them..."

Test me with "examine report / read report".
