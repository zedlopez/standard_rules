"Zodiac"

The Secluded Alley is a room. The Capricorn Killer is a man in the Secluded Alley.

The player carries a can of mace and a roll of duct tape.

Instead of doing something other than examining with the Capricorn Killer:
	say "You wouldn't dare!"

Test me with "x me / x killer / touch killer / smell mace".
