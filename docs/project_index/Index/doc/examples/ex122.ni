"Spring Cleaning"

A thing can be tough or fragile. A thing is usually tough.

Instead of attacking something fragile:
	say "You smash [the noun] to smithereens!";
	now the noun is nowhere.

A knick-knack is a kind of thing which is fragile.

Every turn when a knick-knack is off-stage and Granny Blue can see the player:
	say "'Ohh,' whimpers Granny to herself softly. 'How I will miss [the list of off-stage knick-knacks]!'"

The Parlor is a room. Granny Blue is a woman in the Parlor. A china lamb, a porcelain milkmaid, a frolicking Dutch cow, and a crystal unicorn are knick-knacks in the Parlor.

Test me with "break lamb / break milkmaid / break cow / break unicorn".
