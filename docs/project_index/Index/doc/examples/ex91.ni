"Lucy"

The International Boardgame Championship is a room. Lucy is a woman in the Championship.

Instead of asking Lucy about "checkers":
	try asking Lucy about "games".

Instead of asking Lucy about "games",
	say "'I don't like games,' she sniffs."

Test me with "ask lucy about checkers / ask lucy about games".
