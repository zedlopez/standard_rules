<h3>RB §13.1. Testing</h3>
<p>There are no recipes for testing, alas, although most experienced IF authors have their preferred ways of going about it. Briefly: the best advice is to build and maintain a Skein which holds complete play-throughs of the piece, so that it is easy to check with a single click that all is still well; to have beta-testers who play through (substantial) drafts and send back their transcripts of play, along with suggestions; and to listen to these suggestions, and treat the beta-testers as editors rather than galley slaves.</p>
<p><a href="rb_13.html#example-414" class="example-link" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example-414').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();">Alpha</a><span class="example-difficulty"> ★</span> shows a way to gracefully accept beta-testers' annotations without advancing time in the story.</p>
<p>Most large works of IF have historically provided secret commands for testing and debugging - commands removed (or sometimes accidentally not) in the final released product. Inform does this automatically: the commands SHOWME, ACTIONS and SCENES are always present except in a released story file. It also allows us to write passages of source text which apply only for the testing phase, so that we can define new testing commands, or other checks that all is well: <a href="rb_13.html#example-3" class="example-link" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example-3').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();">Bic</a><span class="example-difficulty"> ★</span> demonstrates this, and is also useful in its own right.</p>

<p>Sometimes we want to let testers of a game insert their own comments during a transcript, without those comments wasting turns of the game or producing lengthy or inappropriate parser errors. Many testers have a habit of prefacing comments with a punctuation mark, so let's say that we'd like to catch any command that starts with any punctuation at all:</p>

<h3>RB §13.2. Publishing</h3>
<p>These three examples simply show what can be done using Inform's EPS-format map output, if one is willing to tweak the design in some vector-art program. Unfortunately, at present, there are few alternatives to Adobe Illustrator - a superb but very expensive program - in the field of EPS editing, and indeed, of vector art generally: this is especially the case for Windows users. Inkscape is a usable free alternative, but it needs to have EPS files translated to PDFs before they can be used. On Mac OS X, the built-in Preview application can do this; otherwise the open-source Ghostscript might be used, but it can be a pain to install. Still, for the IF author who does have EPS editing facilities available, Inform will play nicely with them.</p>

<p>This sentence has become a long catalogue of specifications. To break it down: we disambiguate the placement of Thames Street End, which otherwise is hard to locate because the directions to and from the room are not symmetrical. Then we apply some general rules about size, font, and color. Finally, we add instructions about offsetting the room locations of a few specific rooms.</p>
<p>This last part is a bit finicky and will not be necessary in many cases, but our goal this time is to create a map diagram that can be superimposed on the real coastal outline of Port Royal at the time. With a bit of editing, the result looks like this:</p>

<p>The map-maker can be used in quite versatile ways, in short; though the default is a schematic line-and-box affair, that is hardly the only option. While the EPS created is not always the result of our dreams, Inform usually can be made to do most of the hard and boring part, leaving the author to do only a bit of aesthetic touchup.</p>

<p>This produces a line-and-dot map, where the names of rooms do not appear inside the city-circles, but rather (thanks to "room-name-offset") off to one side. We specify a long room-name-length because we want all the names of the cities spelled out in full; and we make all the elements white because we intend to place them over a black background layer.</p>
<p>We can then superimpose this on a vector map of Greece and tweak the exact positions of cities a little by hand (in Adobe Illustrator, as it happens, but other programs would also allow this level of editing). The result:</p>
