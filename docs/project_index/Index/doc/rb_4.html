<h3>RB §4.1. The Passage Of Time</h3>
<p>A story that makes heavy use of time may want to give the player a hint that time is important - and an easy way to keep track of how it's going - by adding the current time to the status line, instead of the score. To do this, we would write</p>

<div class="code"><p class="quoted">
When play begins: change the right hand status line to "[time of day]".
</p></div>
<p>All else being equal, time passes at a rate of one minute per turn. But this need not be so: we can imagine a story where turns take much less time, or much more; or a story in which the passage of time was sometimes suspended, or one in which different actions required different amounts of time to perform.</p>

<p>An alternative approach to time is not to tell the player specifically what hour of the day it is at all, but to move from one general time period to another as it becomes appropriate - when the player has solved enough puzzles, or worked his way through enough of the plot. To this end we might use scenes representing, say, Thursday afternoon and then Thursday evening; then our scene rules, rather than the clock, would determine when Thursday afternoon stopped and Thursday evening began:</p>

<div class="code">
<p class="quoted">
Thursday afternoon is a scene. Thursday evening is a scene.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Thursday afternoon ends when the player carries the portfolio.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Thursday evening begins when Thursday afternoon ends.
<br>When Thursday evening begins:
<br>    say "The great clock over St. Margaret's begins to chime 6.";
</p>
</div>
<p>Though this gives time a loose relation to the number of turns played, it feels surprisingly realistic: players tend to think of time in a story in terms of the number of <em>significant</em> moves they made, while the random wandering, taking inventory, and looking at room descriptions while stuck don't make as big an impression. So advancing the story clock alongside the player's puzzle solutions or plot progress can work just as well as any stricter calculation.</p>

<p>Implicit takes are a convenience to players; in general, we would like to avoid asking players to type any more obvious commands than strictly necessary, while allowing the computer to guess as much as it safely can.</p>
<p>Occasionally, though, we have designed a timed puzzle in which the player has a limited number of moves in which to accomplish his objectives. In that case, the implicit take complicates matters, because it means that a player who types</p>

<div class="code"><p class="quoted">
&gt;EAT GATEAU
<br>(first taking the gateau...)
</p></div>
<p>gets away with a spare move compared to the precise but naïf dupe who types</p>

<div class="code"><p class="quoted">
&gt;TAKE GATEAU
<br>&gt;EAT GATEAU
</p></div>
<p>...and really, that doesn't seem quite fair. The way to fix this problem is to fill in the extra minute on the clock during the implicit take; and that is indeed what we do in the following example.</p>

<p>Time is counted forward after the schedule has already been consulted, so that only the 9:30 AM event happens between 9:30 and 9:45; the next two appear to occur between 9:45 and 10:00 AM, and the 9:50 AM event is not reported until the 10:00 AM to 10:15 wait.

<p class="quoted">
The take visual actions out of world rule is listed before the every turn stage rule in the turn sequence rules.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
This is the take visual actions out of world rule: if acting fast, rule succeeds.
</p>
</div>
<p>Thus the rest of the turn sequence rulebook is omitted for looking or examining: in effect, they become out-of-world actions like "saving the game". If we wanted to add, say, taking inventory to the list of instant activities, we would just need to define it as acting fast, too.</p>
<p>Now the scenario for testing:</p>

<div class="code">
<p class="quoted">
When play begins:
<br>    say "You are cornered by a pack of zombie wolves, armed only with a torch and a pair of pinking shears. This may be your last moment on earth, unless you can think fast!"
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Cleft is a room. "You're backed into a cleft in the granite: behind you are only steep, high faces of stone, and before you a narrow passage."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
The plural of zombie wolf is zombie wolves. A zombie wolf is a kind of animal. Four zombie wolves are in Cleft.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Rule for writing a paragraph about zombie wolves:
<br>    say "The good news is that there isn't much space in which for the zombie wolves to attack.";
<br>    now every zombie wolf is mentioned.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
A steep high face of stone is scenery in Cleft. Understand "rock" as the stone. The description is "Now that you look more closely, there appear to be pitons driven into the rock."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Some pitons are part of the stone. The description of the pitons is "It looks as though someone else has made this ascent before."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Instead of climbing the stone, try going up. Instead of climbing the pitons, try going up.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Above the Cleft is Clifftop.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Every turn when the location is Cleft:
<br>    say "Alas, your time has run out. The alpha wolf springs--";
<br>    end the story.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Every turn when the location is Clifftop:
<br>    say "After a breathless climb, you emerge at last onto the open clifftop.";
<br>    end the story finally.

<p>Here we move to a systematic way of giving different durations to different actions, including even variations on the same act -- so that for instance climbing a steep hill might take several minutes more than other going actions. We do this by setting a number, "work duration", to represent the number of minutes consumed by a given action, and then consulting a rulebook to find out how long the past turn's action should take. By default, an action will take 1 minute.</p>
<p>We'll start by emulating the behavior of "Uptempo": each turn we'll set the clock forward most of the way, then check to see what has changed since the last turn, print any relevant events, and only then set the clock forward the final minute. The exception is when an action is set to take no time at all; in that case, we'll skip the rest of the turn sequence rules entirely.</p>

<h3>RB §4.2. Scripted Scenes</h3>
<p>Sometimes we want to arrange a scene in which something goes on in the background (as though it were a movie playing) while the player goes about his business; or where a series of things has to happen before the player gets to the end.</p>
<p>The simplest way to arrange background events for a scene is to write the sequence of events into a table and work our way through it, printing one line per turn, until the scene runs out. <a href="rb_4.html#example-159" class="example-link" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example-159').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();">Day One</a><span class="example-difficulty"> ★★★</span> does exactly this.</p>
<p>At other times, we want a scene to last as long as it takes the <em>player</em> to do something. <a href="rb_4.html#example-155" class="example-link" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example-155').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();">Entrapment</a><span class="example-difficulty"> ★★</span> lets the player poke around and explore as much as he likes, but ends as soon as he has accomplished the scene's goal - which, unfortunately for him, is to get into an embarrassing situation so that another character can walk in and make fun of him. <a href="rb_4.html#example-162" class="example-link" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example-162').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();">The Prague Job</a><span class="example-difficulty"> ★</span> has a scene that requires the player to do a more specific set of tasks, but nags him and hurries him along until he's done.</p>

<p>For more complex sorts of scripts and schedules, it may be worth consulting the extensions.</p>

The player carries a lockpick, a smoke bomb, a grappling hook, and a pair of gloves. The description of the lockpick is "Effective on most kinds of key locks, it is a gift from your mentor in the discipline, old Wheezy." The description of the smoke bomb is "Your last of these, so you should rely on it only when other modes of escape have vanished. It takes effect when dropped, producing a cloud of purple haze sufficient to fill a medium-sized room." The description of the grappling hook is "Good for shooting at balconies and other sorts of overhang."  The gloves are wearable. The description of the gloves is "Black and shiny, with gripping material on the palms. Batman would be jealous."

<p>The power of scenes lies in their ability to watch for general conditions and move the narrative along whenever these are fulfilled. Instead of waiting for the player to do one specific thing, the game waits for the world to be in a certain condition, before moving to the next stage of the plot.</p>
<p>For instance, suppose we have a story in which the player has been captured for doing something inappropriate at court and is brought in to await a meeting with a palace official. We want to give the player a few minutes to stew, and we want the scene to end with him doing something mildly peculiar or embarrassing, and the official catching him in the act. So we tempt him into trying any of a number of different kooky activities, and just wait until he falls into the trap...</p>

Waiting Suite is a room. "You find yourself in a narrow room, more cozy than is really comfortable, with dark paneling on all the walls. Underfoot is a thick carpet the color of dried blood. The head of a dragon kit is mounted on the wall."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
The wood paneling is scenery in the Waiting Suite. The description is "Just the sort of ornate panels that might conceal a carved switch. You've heard all sorts of rumors about secret rooms and passages in the palace, some of which have not been opened in centuries because no one remembers how to get at them." Understand "panels" or "panel" or "panelling" as the paneling.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Instead of switching on the paneling, say "First you'll have to locate any switches or catches with a careful search."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
The thick carpet is scenery in the Waiting Suite. Understand "red" or "blood" or "rug" as the carpet. The description is "A dull, unwelcoming weave, only a touch redder than the wood around you. You discern that it does not lie perfectly flat."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Instead of touching the paneling for the first time: say "You run your hands over the paneling with a methodical touch, knowing exactly what you're looking for but never quite feeling anything that gives or twists; then thump lightly, looking for hollow spaces."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Instead of touching the paneling for the second time: say "With increased vigor, you run your fingers along the borders between panels, then smack each panel sharply at the center. No luck yet, but if you keep at it, you're bound to turn up anything that's there to find."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Instead of attacking the paneling: try touching the paneling. Instead of searching the paneling: try touching the paneling. Understand "knock on [something]" or "tap [something]" or "tap on [something]" as attacking.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
After touching the paneling when the player is not confident:
<br>    say "Having polished off all the panels within easy reach, you now have to contort yourself around furniture here and crawl along the floorboards there, hitting each panel three times quite solidly before moving on.";
<br>now the player is embarrassed.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Instead of looking under the carpet for the first time:
<br>    say "You take a corner of the carpet and tug. The floor is sticky, so it doesn't come up on the first try."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
A small table is an enterable supporter in the Waiting Suite. On the table is a copy of Dragon Pursuit Today. The description of Dragon Pursuit Today is "Full of glossy illustrations of dragons in various stages of capture, captivity, and destruction. The back of the magazine contains small black-and-white advertisements for hunting kits and the like." Some advertisements and some illustrations are part of Dragon Pursuit Today. The description of the illustrations is "You have the misfortune to look first at the photographs accompanying 'Cleaning Dragon Splanchna', and feel quite unwell." The description of the advertisements is "Mostly terse ads and phone numbers."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
After looking under the table:
<br>    say "It's quite a low table and you have to get down on your knees and poke your head underneath in order to get a good look."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
After looking under the carpet:
<br>    say "You pull again at the carpet. There is a tug, then a tearing, as the ancient fabric struggles against the fabric glue. Some of the carpet winds up in your hand and some of it remains in patchy threads adhering to the floor."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
After entering the table:

The dragon head is scenery in the Waiting Suite. Understand "kit" or "mouth" as the dragon head. The description is "Its eyes are wide with bewildered surprise; its mouth gapes, its forked tongue protrudes indignantly. From down here it looks as though there's something shiny stuck in its mouth, though you can't tell for sure." The head contains a shiny thing. The description of the shiny thing is "Intriguing but impossible to see clearly." Instead of taking the shiny thing, try searching the dragon head.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Before searching the dragon head:
<br>    if the player is not on the table, try entering the table;
<br>    if the player is not on the table, stop the action.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
After searching the dragon head: say "You have a good look inside the dragon's mouth. There's a ball of lucite inside, propping the jaw in display position."

A person can be confident, nervous, or embarrassed. The player is confident.

Touching the paneling is embarrassing behavior.  Looking under the carpet is embarrassing behavior. Entering the table is embarrassing behavior. Looking under the table is embarrassing behavior.

Instead of embarrassing behavior:
<br>    if the player is nervous, now the player is embarrassed;
<br>    if the player is confident:

<br>        now the player is nervous;
<br>    otherwise:
<br>        continue the action.

Causing trouble is a scene. Causing trouble begins when play begins. Causing trouble ends when the player is embarrassed. When Causing trouble ends: say "Just at this inopportune moment, you hear a throat being cleared behind you. 'We can see you now within,' says a dry voice."; end the story saying "To be continued..."

<p>...and this scene might lead to another, and so on.</p>
<p>The purpose of an open-ended scene like this might be puzzly or narrative: we might be waiting for the player to get a puzzle solved, or we might be waiting for him to fulfil some plot condition that must be met before we can go on.</p>

Lecture is a scene. Lecture begins when play begins.

Every turn during Lecture:

<br>        say "[event entry][paragraph break]";
<br>        blank out the whole row;

<p>Here we use a table (see subsequent chapters) to keep track of all the events we wish to have occur during the course of the scene.</p>

Table of Lecture Events
<br>event
<br>"'Welcome to Precolumbian Archaeology 101,' thunders Dr Freitag from the front of the class. 'Miss-- yes, you in the back. If you can't find a free seat, how are you going to find Atlantis? Sit down or leave. Now. Thank you.'"
<br>"Freitag stands behinds his desk and lines up the pile of books there more neatly. 'It has come to my attention over previous years that there are two sorts of person who enroll in my class,' he says.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
'Some of you will be members of the swim team or women's lacrosse players who have a distribution requirement to fulfill and are under the mistaken impression that archaeology must be easier than psychology. If that description applies to you, I advise you to drop the class now rather than at the midterm break. Under absolutely no circumstances will I ever sign a withdrawal form for someone who is crying at the time. Make a note of that, please.'"
<br>"'The second sort of person,' Dr Freitag says, getting another wind. 'Yes, the second sort of person takes this class because she imagines that it is going to lead to adventure or possibly to new age encounters with dolphins.'
</p>
<p class="quoted">
His eye moves over the class, lingering an especially long time on a girl in a patchwork skirt.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
'You should also leave now, but since you are probably lying to yourself about the reasons you're here, you will probably not heed my warning and we will be doomed to a semester of one another's company nonetheless.'"
<br>"'Whatever you may tell yourself, you are not here to gain a deeper understanding of the world or get in touch with yourself or experience another culture.'
</p>
<p class="quoted">
He paces before the first row of desks, hammering on them one at a time. 'I know you probably wrote an admissions statement saying that that is what you hoped to do. Well, too bad. It is not inconceivable that some of you, somehow, will muddle towards a deeper understanding of something thanks to this class, but I am not holding my breath, and neither should you.'"
<br>"Freitag takes a breath. 'No, my dear freshwomen, what you are here to do is learn facts. FACTS. Facts are unpopular in this university and, I am unhappily aware, at most of the institutions of inferior preparation from which you have come. Nonetheless, facts it will be. I will expect you to learn names. I will expect you to learn dates. I will expect you to study maps and I will expect you to produce evidence of exacting geographical knowledge on the exams. I will expect you to learn shapes of pottery and memorize masonry designs. There are no principles you can learn which are more important or more useful than a truly colossal bank of facts right there in your own head.'"
<br>"'I do not ever want to hear that you do not need to learn things because you will be able to look them up. This is the greatest fallacy of your computer-semi-literate generation, that you can get anything out of Google if you need it. Not only is this demonstrably false, but it overlooks something phenomenally important: you only know to look for something if you already know it EXISTS. In short there is no way to fake knowledge, and I am not going to pretend there is.' He smiles in lupine fashion.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
'This class is likely to be the most miserable experience of your four years in university. Clear?'"
<br>"Everyone is silent."
<br>"The lecture is interrupted by the shrill of a bell."
</p>
</div>
<p>And then we define the scene so that it ends when the table runs out.</p>

<div class="code"><p class="quoted">
Lecture ends when the number of filled rows in the Table of Lecture Events is 0.
</p></div>
<p>One advantage of this is that we can then edit the events in the scene by changing just the table; the scene will always run the right length and end on the turn when the last event occurs.</p>
<p>And to add a few additional details:</p>

<div class="code"><p class="quoted">
Instead of doing something other than waiting, looking, listening or examining during Lecture:
<br>    say "Dr Freitag glares at you so fiercely that you are frozen into inaction."
</p></div>
<p>Notice the careful phrasing of "doing something other than..." so that we do not mention the objects; if we had written "something other than listening to something...", the instead rule would match only action patterns which involved a noun. We state the rule more generally so that it will also match nounless commands such as JUMP and SING, since Freitag will probably take a dim view of those as well.</p>

<div class="code">
<p class="quoted">
When Lecture ends:
<br>    now Freitag is nowhere;
<br>    say "There is a flurry of movement as your fellow students begin to put away their books. Dr Freitag makes his way to the door and is gone before anyone can ask him anything."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
The Classroom is a room. Dr Freitag is a man in the Classroom. "Dr Freitag paces before the blackboard."

<p>Scenes can have properties -- a fact that is very useful when it comes to writing a series of scenes that all need to act alike in some respect.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a plot that features a number of scripted scenes, where we need the player to stand still and wait while the events of the scene play out. One way to set this up is to create a property for such scenes -- let's call them "restricted" -- and then write a rule that keeps the player in place while the scene happens:</p>

Section 1 - The Procedure
</p>
<p class="quoted">
A scene can be restricted or free.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Instead of going somewhere during a restricted scene:
<br>    say "Better to stay here for the moment and find out what is going to happen next."
</p>
</div>
<p>And now let's set up our restricted scene. In it, a clown is going to turn up wherever the player is (it doesn't matter where on the map he's gotten to at this point) and do a performance; the player will not be able to leave the area until the performance completes. We'll start with the setting:</p>

<div class="code">
<p class="quoted">
Section 2 - The Stage and Props
</p>
<p class="quoted">
The Broad Lawn is a room. "A sort of fun fair has been set up on this broad lawn, with the House as a backdrop: it's an attempt to give local children something to do during the bank holiday. In typical fashion, everyone is doing a very good job of ignoring the House itself, despite its swarthy roofline and dozens of blacked-out windows."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
The House is scenery in the Broad Lawn. The description is "A cautious vagueness about the nature of the inhabitants is generally considered a good idea. They might be gods, or minor demons, or they might be aliens from space, or possibly they are embodiments of physical principles, or expressions of universal human experience, or... at any rate they can run time backward and forward so it warbles like an old cassette. And they're always about when somebody dies. Other than that, they're very good neighbors and no one has a word to say against."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Instead of entering the House:
<br>    say "You can't go in, of course. It's not a house for people."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
The Gazebo is north of the Broad Lawn. "The gazebo is sometimes used for bands, but at the moment has been appropriated for the distribution of lemonade."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
The clown is a man. "A clown wearing [a list of things worn by the clown] stands nearby." The description is "He winks back at you."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
The clown wears a purple polka-dot bowler hat. He carries a supply of baby geese. The description of the supply of baby geese is "Three or four. Or five. It's hard to count." Understand "goose" or "gosling" or "goslings" as the supply of baby geese.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
There are some eggs. The description of the eggs is "A blur, really."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
There is a Spanish omelet. The description of the Spanish omelet is "Exquisitely prepared."
</p>
</div>
<p>...And now the scene itself:</p>

<div class="code">
<p class="quoted">
Section 3 - The Scenes
</p>
<p class="quoted">
The Clown Performance is a restricted scene. Clown Performance begins when the turn count is 3.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
When Clown Performance begins:
<br>    move the clown to the location.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Every turn during Clown Performance:
<br>    repeat through the Table of Clowning:
<br>        say "[event description entry][paragraph break]";
<br>        blank out the whole row;
<br>        stop.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
When Clown Performance ends:
<br>    now the eggs are nowhere;
<br>    now the clown carries the omelet.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Clown Performance ends when the number of filled rows in the Table of Clowning is 0.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Table of Clowning
<br>event description
<br>"A clown with a purple polka-dot bowler hat strides into the vicinity and begins to juggle baby geese."
<br>"While the clown juggles, the baby geese visibly grow older and larger. The clown becomes unnerved."
<br>"In an attempt to resolve the problem, the clown reverses the direction of his juggling. The geese revert to goslings."
<br>"The goslings become smaller and smaller until the clown is juggling goose eggs[replace eggs]."
<br>"The clown throws all the eggs into the air at once and catches them in the bowler hat. He takes a bow; the audience applauds. As a final gesture, he upends his hat to release a perfectly cooked omelet."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
To say replace eggs:
<br>    now the supply of baby geese is nowhere;
<br>    now the clown carries the eggs.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Free Time is a scene. Free Time begins when Clown Performance Ends.

<h3>RB §4.3. Event Scheduling</h3>
<p>We can use a schedule of events to give some life to our environment: if we have a town setting, for instance, it makes sense for shops and libraries to open and close at set times; this is just what we find in <a href="rb_4.html#example-141" class="example-link" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example-141').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();">IPA</a><span class="example-difficulty"> ★★</span>.</p>
<p><a href="rb_4.html#example-354" class="example-link" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example-354').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();">Air Conditioning Is Standard</a><span class="example-difficulty"> ★★★★</span> has characters who follow a timed schedule of events to interact with each other, while the player mostly wanders around missing out on the action. (Sometimes life is like that.) The same effects could have been achieved with scenes instead of clock times, but there are occasions when we do want to plan our characters' behavior to the minute rather than waiting for the player to be in the right place to observe it: in a murder mystery or a time-travel story, the exact timings might be quite significant.</p>
<p>We may also want to add events to the schedule during play, as in</p>

<div class="code">
<p class="quoted">
 Instead of pushing the egg-timer: say "It begins to mark time."; the egg-timer clucks in four turns from now.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
At the time when the egg-timer clucks: say "Cluck! Cluck! Cluck! says the egg-timer."
</p>
</div>
<p>Similarly, we can schedule things during play to happen at a specific time of day, as shown in <a href="rb_4.html#example-146" class="example-link" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example-146').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();">Hour of the Wren</a><span class="example-difficulty"> ★★★</span>.</p>

<p>Suppose we wanted a game set in a living town, with locations opening and closing at different times of day, and business carrying on as usual. The point might be to force the player to plan his itinerary carefully to hit the right spots at the right times; or we might be writing a more contemplative piece, where part of the enjoyment came from just watching the characters wander around doing their daily business...</p>

<p>Here we allow the player to set the time at which some future event is going to happen, rather than letting the game decide. We'll need to borrow the syntax for defining new actions from a later chapter:</p>

<p class="quoted">
When play begins:
<br>    say "You more or less stumble across them in Central Park: a disparate group of people, all of different ages, sitting in a circle. They aren't talking to one another -- in fact, they seem to be trying very hard to ignore one another, like people in the waiting room of an especially embarrassing kind of doctor. You are about to go around when a woman in a grey pressed suit comes up to you. Her suit-skirt is trimmed in lavender cord, and she looks as though she might have been extremely sharp-dressed in 1944. She hands you a card."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
The Circle in the Grass is a room. "No one is looking at you, except for the secretary, if that is what she is."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
The player carries a card. The description of the card is "Typed: 'Active astrology - dislike your fortunes? change your stars! - make an appointment now - hour of the wren STILL AVAILABLE.'".
</p>
<p class="quoted">
The time of day is 1:55 PM.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Understand "pick [time]" or "choose [time]" or "make appointment for [time]" or "make an appointment for [time]" as making an appointment for. Making an appointment for is an action applying to one time.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Carry out making an appointment for:
<br>    say "Fate cannot be commanded more than once."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Instead of making an appointment for the time understood for the first time:
<br>    say "You settle on [the time understood] for your appointment. The woman makes a note of it in an appointment book, which she carries in a brown paper bag. 'Excellent choice, ma'am,' she says in a low, urgent voice. 'You'll be very satisfied.'";
<br>    stars shift at the time understood.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Understand "hour of the wren" as 2:00 PM.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
At the time when stars shift:
<br>    end the story saying "insert cataclysm here".
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Test me with "x card / make appointment for hour of the wren / z / z / z / z".

Part I - Serial
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Red Spot is a room. "You are in the middle of a vast red oval plain. Overhead, the thick Jovian clouds swirl menacingly, and a fine acrid dust falls instead of rain." Some acrid dust is scenery in the Red Spot. The description of the dust is "The rust-colored dust coats every surface. You've no idea how deep it goes."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Instead of going in Red Spot, say "As you once told Cadet Lucky, Jupiter's a mighty big planet, maybe bigger than Iowa. Why, the Red Spot alone stretches out almost to the horizon."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
The player wears a silver uniform and rubber boots. The player carries a shovel and an Analscope. The description of the Analscope is "As you recall from Space Patrol #9 - 1952-11-29 - The Electronic Burglar, the Analscope is a device for locating buried metals. That's what guided you all the way from the orbit of Uranus. (Oh, all right, Neptune.) If only you hadn't crashed!"
</p>
<p class="quoted">
The metal plate is a fixed in place container. It is openable and closed. In the metal plate is some water. The description of the metal plate is "Stamped with the distinctive logo of the previous mission."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Instead of examining the player, say "Your hair clumps together stickily, thanks to the dustfall."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Digging is an action applying to one thing. Understand "dig [something]" or "dig in [something]" as digging.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Instead of digging the dust, try looking under the dust. Instead of looking under the dust when the metal plate is not visible: move the metal plate to the location; say "You brush aside the dust underfoot and -- what were the odds? -- it turns out that you landed just where the previous landing party did, thirteen ill-fated years ago. Here is the metal plate that covers their original well.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
But wait! Called by the clanging of your shovel on the plate, a band of Jovian pterodactyls swoop down to attack! You're totally defenceless! You don't have a hope! You're absolutely finished!"; increase the score by 10; move K-Klak to Red Spot.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
K-Klak the Pterodactyl is an animal. "K-Klak, leader of the Jupiter Pterodactyls, menaces you. A terrifying creature of scaly wings, with a dragon's tail, K-Klak stands... about 1/8th of an inch tall." Instead of doing something to K-Klak, say "K-Klak makes a frankly panicky noise and leaps backwards, out of your way."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
After opening the metal plate: increase the score by 10; say "You have found water! You're saved! K-Klak makes a (very cautiously) pleased noise. Now to find the stolen Brainograph, and track down the crook with the thick Jewish accent and his henchmen with their thick Polish accents..."; end the story finally.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
The maximum score is 20.

Part II - Cereal
</p>
<p class="quoted">
When play begins, say "Instant Ralstons and Regular Ralstons, the hot whole-wheat cereals in the red and white checkerboard packages present... SPACE PATROL... High adventure in the wild vast reaches of space... Missions of daring in the name of interplanetary justice... Travel into the future as Buzz Corey, Commander-in-Chief of the..."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Last score is a number that varies. Every turn: now the last score is the score.

<p class="quoted">
Ralstons Ad is a scene. Ralstons Ad begins when score is not the last score. Ralstons Ad ends when the Ricechex is consumed.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Include Basic Screen Effects by Emily Short.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
When Ralstons Ad begins:
<br>    center "*** We'll be back in just a moment! ***";
<br>    pause the game;
<br>    strip the player;
<br>    move the player to the Kitchen.
</p>

When Ralstons Ad ends:
<br>    center "*** And now, back to today's exciting adventure ***";
<br>    pause the game;
<br>    restore the player.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Saved location is a room that varies. Locker is a container. Wardrobe is a container.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
To strip the player:
<br>    now every thing carried by the player is in the locker;
<br>    now every thing worn by the player is in the wardrobe;
<br>    now saved location is location.

<p class="quoted">
To restore the player:
<br>    now every thing carried by the player is in the Kitchen;
<br>    now every thing in the locker is carried by the player;
<br>    now every thing in the wardrobe is worn by the player;
<br>    move the player to saved location.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
The Space Patrol Kitchen is a room. "The nerve center of the Space Patrol! This is where cadets fill up with their SUPER-FUEL. North leads to the astro control room, while back south is the cargo hold." A breakfast bowl is in the Kitchen. In the bowl is Ricechex. Ricechex is edible. The Ricechex can be consumed or uneaten. The Ricechex is uneaten.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Instead of going north in Kitchen: say "[refusal to leave]". Instead of going south in Kitchen: say "[refusal to leave]".
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Instead of examining the player when Ralstons Ad is happening: say "You are currently being played by a generically attractive person of about 30, with very good teeth and well-kept nails."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
After eating the Ricechex: say "That's right folks, always start your day the SPACE PATROL way with a tasty bowl of Ricechex, Wheatchex or good hot Ralstons. Mmmm Mmmm. You just can't get enough of the sugary goodness in Ricechex, Wheatchex and good hot Ralstons."; now the ricechex is consumed.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Instead of tasting the Ricechex:
<br>    say "Wow! *wolf-whistle* Man oh man oh man! Yumm-y!"
</p>
<p class="quoted">
To say refusal to leave:
<br>    repeat through Table of Refusals:

<p>For some games, it makes sense to organize the entire game around scenes rather than around locations, moving the player when a new scene begins and laying out new props.</p>
<p>To this end, we might extend Inform's default handling of scenes so that each scene has properties to indicate prop lists and locations, and move objects in and out of play automatically as the scenes change. For instance:</p>

Part 1 - Procedure
</p>
<p class="quoted">
A scene has a room called the starting location.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
A scene has a list of objects called the scenery props.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
A scene has a list of objects called the inventory props.
</p>
</div>
<p>The starting location is the room to which the player should be moved; scenery props are things that need to be put there when the scene begins; inventory props, things that are given to the player when the scene begins; and the description some printed text to introduce the new scene. We may still occasionally need to have recourse to special "When the Dancing-Lesson begins..." rules for individual scenes, but for the most part this allows us to set scenes up in a consistent and predictable way.</p>
<p>Another point that might be slightly less obvious: sometimes we want to announce a change of location to the player when the scene starts, and sometimes we don't. In particular any scene that starts "when play begins" should probably not explicitly describe the entered room, since that would duplicate the description automatically produced on the first turn of play. So we add a property to track whether any given scene should be announcing its location:</p>

<div class="code"><p class="quoted">
A scene can be location-silent or location-loud.
</p></div>
<p>And let's say that we also want to announce each new scene as another "chapter" of the game in play, with a pause before the scene begins.</p>
<p>Here we include "Basic Screen Effects" because it will allow us to pause the game for a keypress, then clear the screen before each new chapter:</p>

<div class="code">
<p class="quoted">
Include Basic Screen Effects by Emily Short.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
The chapter counter is a number that varies.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
First when a scene (called the current scene) which is not the Entire Game begins:
<br>    if chapter counter is greater than 0:
<br>        pause the game;
<br>    increment chapter counter;
<br>    say "[bold type]Chapter [chapter counter]: [current scene][roman type]";
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Last when a scene (called the current scene) which is not the Entire Game begins:
<br>    repeat with item running through the scenery props of the current scene:
<br>        move the item to the starting location of the current scene;
<br>    repeat with item running through the inventory props of the current scene:
<br>        move the item to the player;
<br>    if the location is not the starting location of the current scene:
<br>        if the current scene is location-loud:
<br>            move the player to the starting location of the current scene;
<br>        otherwise:
<br>            move the player to the starting location of the current scene, without printing a room description.
</p>
</div>
<p>At the end of each scene, we strike the set and remove all the loose objects from play.</p>

<div class="code">
<p class="quoted">
When a scene (called the current scene) ends:
<br>    repeat with item running through things which are not fixed in place:
<br>        if the item is not the player:
<br>            now the item is nowhere.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Part 2 - Scenario
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Entrevaux Station is a room. "The station building consists of a waiting room and a ticket-selling office so small that only one person can buy a ticket at a time. On the outside wall is a clock that runs twelve minutes late; but since the trains also run twelve minutes, give or take, behind their published schedule, this clock is helpful in establishing reasonable expectations. [paragraph break]Painted on the door is the logo of the Chemin de Fer de Provence, the only railway in France that is not part of the SNCF."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
The Hillside Tower is a room. "It's very dark in here, lacking artificial lighting, but from the rough rectangular window you can see a slice of hillside and a little of the river Var."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
The window is scenery in the Hillside Tower. The description is "Through it can be seen a slice of wooded hillside and exposed grey-brown cliff. You are in the southern French foothills of the Alps, and the territory is dry. The only respite is the river Var, a milky blue at this time of year, running shallowly over mud and large stones far below your window." Understand "view" or "slice of hillside" or "hillside" or "hill" or "river" or "var" or "mud" or "stones" or "large stones" as the window.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
A used ticket is a thing. The description is "A piece of receipt paper indicating that you have paid the one-way fare of 9 euros from Nice. There is a hole punched through it."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
A one-euro coin is a thing. The description is "It's a bimetal coin, brassy around the rim and silvery in the center. One side shows western Europe, with unusual prominence given to the UK, and the other side Leonardo da Vinci's four-armed, four-legged man having a nice stretch. It's dated 2002."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Some re-enactors are a person. "Milling about one end of the station is a crowd of medieval re-enactors." The description is "They're dressed in a somewhat aimless range of styles roughly honoring the period of 900-1500 AD. One gentleman is wearing a knobby leather cap; which is a good thing, because there is a rooster standing on his head." Understand "men" or "man" or "gentleman" or "rooster" or "reenactors" or "crowd" or "medieval" or "woman" or "women" as the re-enactors.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
A kidnapper is a person. "Your kidnapper is watching you from the corner with his arms folded. You have the impression he's just marking time until someone more important arrives." The description is "He does not look at all like the kidnapping sort, but more like a sommelier at a superior restaurant: he wears a black pinstriped suit and has nicely-manicured hands."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
The trolley is an enterable fixed in place container. "The 'train' on which you arrived is really just a single car, more like a trolley than a proper train." Understand "car" or "train" as the trolley. The description is "It has a glass front, so you can see ahead while riding: an innovation among trains."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Arrival is a location-silent scene. "After many days['] journey, you have arrived at last in Entrevaux, a walled medieval town now chiefly of interest to tourists and crusade re-enactors."
<br>    The starting location of Arrival is the Entrevaux Station.
<br>    The scenery props of Arrival are { re-enactors, trolley }.
<br>    The inventory props of Arrival are { the used ticket, one-euro coin }.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Arrival begins when play begins. Arrival ends when the time since Arrival began is 2 minutes.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Abduction is a location-loud scene. "You check into the Hotel Vauban and sleep deeply enough; it was a long and sticky trip to get here.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Then in the middle of the night something confusing happens. You have the impression of strangers in your room, and then a searing pain, and you don't come back to yourself until midmorning of the following day..."
<br>    The starting location of Abduction is the Hillside Tower.
<br>    The scenery props of Abduction are { kidnapper }.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Abduction begins when Arrival ends.

<h3>RB §4.5. Flashbacks</h3>
<p>The viewpoint character may often need to remember events long past. The easiest way to do this is with a cut-scene, in which at some relevant point we pause the story and print a long passage of text describing the memory. Because large amounts of text can be hard for the player to take in, we may want to include some pauses in the presentation of this material; this facility is provided by the Basic Screen Effects extension by Emily Short, and might work something like this:</p>

<div class="code">
<p class="quoted">
Include Basic Screen Effects by Emily Short.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Instead of examining the photograph for the first time:
<br>    say "This reminds you of the summer of '69...";
<br>    wait for any key;
<br>    say "... flashback content...";
<br>    wait for any key.
</p>
</div>
<p>The "pause the game" phrase in the same extension offers a more dramatic pause that also clears the screen before printing new text.</p>
<p>Cut-scenes are easy to implement but should be used sparingly, since players often get impatient with long uninteractive passages. A slightly more deluxe implementation might insert an interactive scene that simply happens to be set in the past, before going on with another scene set "now"; and, indeed, some IF abandons the idea of "now" entirely, presenting pieces in a non-chronological order and letting the player work out how the sequence works together.</p>
<p>The most challenging case to implement (though still not very hard) is the one where we remove the player from one scenario, let him play through a flashback with past possessions and clothing, and then restore him to the same situation he left, with all of the same possessions and clothing. <a href="rb_4.html#example-165" class="example-link" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example-165').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();">Pine 3</a><span class="example-difficulty"> ★★★</span> shows how to do this: the code to change the player's status is isolated at the end of the example, and might fruitfully be reused.  <a href="rb_4.html#example-167" class="example-link" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example-167').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();">Pine 4</a><span class="example-difficulty"> ★★★</span> expands on the same idea by adding another flashback scene, demonstrating one that can be visited repeatedly and one that can be seen only once.</p>

A person can be asleep or awake. A person can be active or passive.

<p class="quoted">
The Spinning Tower is a room. "A remote corner of the old castle, reserved for spinning and weaving tasks."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Sleeping Beauty is an asleep woman in the Spinning Tower. "[if asleep]Sleeping Beauty lies here, oblivious to your presence[otherwise]Sleeping Beauty stands beside you, looking [attitude][end if]." The description is "She is even more magnificent than the rumors suggested." Understand "woman" or "girl" or "princess" or "lady" as Sleeping Beauty.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Discovery is a scene. Discovery begins when play begins. Discovery ends when Sleeping Beauty is awake. Marriage Proposal is a scene. Marriage Proposal begins when Discovery ends.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
When Discovery ends: say "Throughout the palace you can hear the other sounds of stirring and movement as the spell of centuries is broken."; now Beauty is passive.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Instead of waking an awake person: say "Redundant."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Instead of waking an asleep person: say "Yes, but how?"
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Instead of attacking an asleep person:
<br>now the noun is awake;
<br>    say "[The noun] sits bolt upright. 'Hey! Ow!' So much for that true love's kiss nonsense."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Instead of kissing an asleep person:
<br>    now the noun is awake;
<br>    say "[The noun] slowly stirs to wakefulness!"
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Instead of throwing water at an asleep person:
<br>    now the second noun is awake;
<br>    now the noun is nowhere;
<br>    say "You pour out [the noun] on [the second noun].
</p>
<p class="quoted">
[The second noun] wakes, shuddering. 'Agh! I had a terrible dream about drowning and then-- Hey!'"
</p>
<p class="quoted">
The player carries a jug of water. Understand "pour [something] on [something]" or "splash [something] at/on [something]" as throwing it at.

When Marriage Proposal ends: end the story saying "This is going to take some explaining."

</div>
<p>So far we haven't much of a chance to affect matters and make them better. Suppose we'd like to add an element to the conversation where we're allowed to tell Beauty about past events -- and explore them a bit; and if the first retelling doesn't go quite as planned, we're allowed to revisit these scenes to hit them with a bit more emphasis.</p>

Part 2 - Flashbacks

<p class="quoted">
Instead of asking an awake beauty about a topic listed in the Table of Flashback Material:
<br>    now Beauty is passive;
<br>    say "[reply entry][paragraph break]".
</p>
<p class="quoted">
A fact is a kind of thing. The family circumstances is a fact. A fact can be known or unknown. A fact can be current or past.
</p>
</div>
<p>Once known, a fact remains known permanently -- this could be useful if we wanted to make some rules about how Beauty acts when she knows different information. By contrast, a fact is only "current" if it is the last thing discussed. Since a player can mention a fact over and over, he can make it "current" again and again, and thus reactivate the flashback.</p>

 After printing the name of a fact (called target): now the target is current; now the target is known.
</p>
</div>
<p>This "After printing the name..." rule will be explained later in the chapter on activities; for now, it is enough to know that whenever family circumstances is mentioned in the table of flashback material, this rule will automatically be called. Now the terms under which the flashback happens:</p>

<div class="code"><p class="quoted">
Poverty flashback is a recurring scene. Poverty flashback begins when family circumstances is current. When poverty flashback begins: strip the player; move the player to the Woodcutter's Shack.
</p></div>
<p>Note the "recurring" here: we want the player to be able to revisit this scene as needed.</p>

<div class="code">
<p class="quoted">
The Woodcutter's Shack is a room. "Your family lives in a shack in the forest. There are holes in the roof, and in the winter the snow comes in -- rain, too, for that matter. The walls aren't very well-boarded, and don't keep out the wind, and even though you live in the middle of dense woods, you can never gather enough fuel to keep this place fully heated. And then there's the stench. Pigs wander freely in and out, and your three youngest brothers play on the floor."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Pigs are an animal in the shack. The pigs are scenery. The description is "They really are very grubby, dirty animals, but what's worse than that, the value of pigs has declined a lot over the last few decades. This is hard to explain to someone who has been out of touch with the world for a while, but keeping pigs for meat is a dubious prospect when there's less and less for them to forage on." Instead of smelling the pigs: say "They smell the way animals do, when they live among their own refuse."; increase the pity of Beauty by 2.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
The brothers are a man. The description of brothers is "Hans, Franz, and Lukas. Twins and then the baby. So young, and growing up fatherless; and soon to be orphaned entirely, if your mother's health does not improve." Understand "brother" or "twin" or "twins" or "baby" or "franz" or "hans" or "lukas" as the brothers.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
The untidy bed is scenery in the Shack. Mother is a woman on the untidy bed. The description of mother is "She is wasting away of a slow disease, her skin stretched tautly over bone. She hasn't been the same since your father left." On the bed is a folded letter.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
The description of the letter is "Many times read over and creased, the letter explains how your father has gone away with a wealthy countess and will not return. Your mother was not able to read it herself, of course, and had to have it explained to her by the parish priest. Now she keeps it by the bed and crumples it in her fits of delirium."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Instead of kissing or touching Mother for the first time:
<br>    say "You place a gentle kiss on her feverish brow. She looks up at you, her oldest -- yes, never mind that bit -- with a look of sincere trust and admiration.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
'You'll find a way through this for us,' she says, squeezing your fingers. 'I know you will.'"; increase the pity of Beauty by 3.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Instead of kissing Mother: say "You have no more heart-rending memories of affection to recount; that one incident will have to serve, for rhetorical purposes."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Instead of waiting in the Shack: say "The wind blows sharply through the walls."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Instead of attacking someone in the Shack:
<br>    say "Though sometimes the conditions of your life make you grouchy and impatient, you would never dream of striking a member of your own family. But from time to time you do feel the temptation."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Beauty has a number called pity. After examining something in the Woodcutter's Shack, increment the pity of Beauty. After examining mother, increase the pity of Beauty by 2. After examining the letter, increase the pity of Beauty by 3.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Poverty flashback ends when waiting or the time since poverty flashback began is five minutes.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
When Poverty flashback ends:
<br>    now family circumstances is past;
<br>    say "...you finish describing the miserable circumstances of your home life, and allow your attention to return to the present.";
<br>    restore the player;
<br>    now Beauty is passive;
<br>    if Beauty is sympathetic, say "'Oh dear!' she says. 'What a dreadful life!' She wrings her hands. 'No wonder you are eager to improve your lot...! But --' Her brow clears, a new thought occurring. 'You needn't marry me, you know! We could arrange it differently! I am certain that my father would give you a large reward, instead, and then I would not be separated from my current boyfriend!'";
<br>    otherwise say "She makes a disgusted face, but she doesn't seem nearly so heart-wrung as you had hoped to make her. Tough audience, these modern princesses."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Definition: Beauty is sympathetic if the pity of Beauty is greater than 4.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
To say attitude:
<br>    if Beauty is sympathetic, say "distressed on your behalf";
<br>    otherwise say "a little confused".
</p>
</div>
<p>And the following is the same as in the Space Patrol example as well: we need a systematic way to remove the player's possessions, then put everything back when the flashback is over:</p>

<div class="code">
<p class="quoted">
Saved location is a room that varies. Locker is a container. Wardrobe is a container.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
To strip the player:
<br>     now every thing carried by the player is in the locker;
<br>    now every thing worn by the player is in the wardrobe;
<br>    now saved location is location.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
To restore the player:
<br>    now every thing carried by the player is in the location;
<br>    now every thing in the locker is carried by the player;
<br>    now every thing in the wardrobe is worn by the player;
<br>    move the player to saved location.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Test me with "x beauty / wake beauty / pour water on beauty / ask beauty about sleep / tell beauty about poverty / smell pigs / x mother / x letter / kiss mother / ask beauty about marriage / z / z".
</p>
</div>
<p>Because we haven't changed the endings of the "Marriage Proposal" scene, there is still only one way for this scenario to work out; but at least now the player has the opportunity to alter Beauty's attitude a bit (or not) before the game is done.</p>
</div>
<div class="linkback">

<p>Suppose in addition to our pathetic little family history, we have another secret to convey to the Princess, this one a little more peculiar. She either gets it or she doesn't; once she gets it, we do not revisit that flashback, though it is still possible to keep visiting the poverty flashback.</p>

Part 1 - The Set-up
</p>
<p class="quoted">
A person can be asleep or awake. A person can be active or passive.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
The Spinning Tower is a room. "A remote corner of the old castle, reserved for spinning and weaving tasks."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Sleeping Beauty is an asleep woman in the Spinning Tower. "[if asleep]Sleeping Beauty lies here, oblivious to your presence[otherwise]Sleeping Beauty stands beside you, looking [attitude][end if]." The description is "She is even more magnificent than the rumors suggested." Understand "woman" or "girl" or "princess" or "lady" as Sleeping Beauty.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Discovery is a scene. Discovery begins when play begins. Discovery ends when Sleeping Beauty is awake. Marriage Proposal is a scene. Marriage Proposal begins when Discovery ends.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
When Discovery ends: say "Throughout the palace you can hear the other sounds of stirring and movement as the spell of centuries is broken."; now Beauty is passive.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Instead of waking an awake person: say "Redundant."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Instead of waking an asleep person: say "Yes, but how?"
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Instead of waiting in the presence of an asleep person (called snorer): say "You are alone with the sound of [the snorer] snoring sonorously."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Instead of attacking an asleep person:
<br>    now the noun is awake;
<br>    say "[The noun] sits bolt upright. 'Hey! Ow!' So much for that true love's kiss nonsense."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Instead of kissing an asleep person:
<br>    now the noun is awake;
<br>    say "[The noun] slowly stirs to wakefulness!"
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Instead of throwing water at an asleep person:
<br>    now the second noun is awake;
<br>    now the noun is nowhere;
<br>    say "You pour out [the noun] on [the second noun].
</p>
<p class="quoted">
[The second noun] wakes, shuddering. 'Agh! I had a terrible dream about drowning and then-- Hey!'"
</p>
<p class="quoted">
The player carries a jug of water. Understand "pour [something] on [something]" or "splash [something] at/on [something]" as throwing it at.

Poverty flashback is a recurring scene. Poverty flashback begins when family circumstances is current. When poverty flashback begins: strip the player; move the player to the Woodcutter's Shack.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
The Woodcutter's Shack is a room. "Your family lives in a shack in the forest. There are holes in the roof, and in the winter the snow comes in -- rain, too, for that matter. The walls aren't very well-boarded, and don't keep out the wind, and even though you live in the middle of dense woods, you can never gather enough fuel to keep this place fully heated. And then there's the stench. Pigs wander freely in and out, and your three youngest brothers play on the floor."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Pigs are an animal in the shack. The pigs are scenery. The description is "They really are very grubby, dirty animals, but what's worse than that, the value of pigs has declined a lot over the last few decades. This is hard to explain to someone who has been out of touch with the world for a while, but keeping pigs for meat is a dubious prospect when there's less and less for them to forage on." Instead of smelling the pigs: say "They smell the way animals do, when they live among their own refuse."; increase the pity of Beauty by 2.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
The brothers are a man in the shack. The brothers are scenery. The description of brothers is "Hans, Franz, and Lukas. Twins and then the baby. So young, and growing up fatherless; and soon to be orphaned entirely, if your mother's health does not improve." Understand "brother" or "twin" or "twins" or "baby" or "franz" or "hans" or "lukas" as the brothers.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
The untidy bed is scenery in the Shack. Mother is a woman on the untidy bed. The description of mother is "She is wasting away of a slow disease, her skin stretched tautly over bone. She hasn't been the same since your father left." On the bed is a folded letter.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
The description of the letter is "Many times read over and creased, the letter explains how your father has gone away with a wealthy countess and will not return. Your mother was not able to read it herself, of course, and had to have it explained to her by the parish priest. Now she keeps it by the bed and crumples it in her fits of delirium."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Instead of kissing or touching Mother for the first time:
<br>    say "You place a gentle kiss on her feverish brow. She looks up at you, her oldest -- yes, never mind that bit -- with a look of sincere trust and admiration.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
'You'll find a way through this for us,' she says, squeezing your fingers. 'I know you will.'"; increase the pity of Beauty by 3.

<p class="quoted">
Instead of kissing Mother: say "You have no more heart-rending memories of affection to recount; that one incident will have to serve, for rhetorical purposes."

Dramatic revelation is a recurring scene. Dramatic revelation begins when attempting confidence.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
To decide whether attempting confidence:
<br>    if dramatic revelation ended in success, no;
<br>    if secret identity is current, yes;
<br>    no.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
When dramatic revelation begins:
<br>    strip the player;
<br>    say "You reminisce about one of the many stops on the way here: you had a long journey from your homeland, and it wasn't made any easier by your poverty, the inability to afford decent inns or plentiful food or any kind of ride along the way.";
<br>    move the player to the Forest Clearing;
<br>    move the pack to the player; now the player wears the trousers; now the player wears the shirt.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Forest Clearing is a room. "It's mid-autumn in your memory, the pool clear and cold, gold and red leaves floating on the surface."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
The pool is scenery in the Clearing. Understand "reflection" or "surface" or "water" as the pool. "The pool is cold but beautiful, and the stopping place a welcome rest." The leaves are scenery in the clearing. The description is "Bright gold and orange and red: it's been a sharply chilly autumn, as you have reason to know in detail."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
The trousers and the shirt are wearable things. The pack is a container. The pack contains ale, food, and skirt. A distraction is a kind of thing. The ale, the food, the pair of trousers, and the shirt are distractions. The description of a distraction is usually "[The item described] is not the point of this story." The shirt and the trousers are wearable. The description of the trousers is "Borrowed from your oldest brother, who is only a year younger than you. They are too long for your legs and overly snug at the hip, but no one around here pays much attention to fashion, and you're getting away with it, more or less." After examining the trousers, increment the clue count of Beauty.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Instead of examining the player during dramatic revelation:
<br>    increment the clue count of Beauty;
<br>    say "You cannot see yourself without reflection, but you can feel your hair loose and unbound over your shoulders."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Rule for printing the name of the skirt while taking inventory: say "one skirt you have not been able to bring yourself to part with". The description of the skirt is "Made for you by your mother, and it looks quite pretty on you. If your primary plan does not work, you may be forced to wear it again, and hope to catch a male eye... but with luck that will not be necessary." After taking inventory: increment clue count of Beauty.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Swimming is an action applying to nothing. Understand "swim" or "dive" as swimming.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Instead of swimming in the presence of the pool:
<br>    increment clue count of Beauty;
<br>    say "You consider going for a swim, but don't dare be caught unclad and unarmed, not here. There are too many men around, and any of them discovering you here would surely take advantage."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Instead of searching or drinking the pool:
<br>    increment clue count of Beauty;
<br>    say "You lean over the pool and look carefully at your reflection, your hair loose and unbound, falling around your face in waves. (That should surely give it away!)"
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Instead of waiting during dramatic revelation: say "You wait for the penny to drop, for her to understand."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Dramatic revelation ends in failure when waiting or the time since dramatic revelation began is five minutes. When dramatic revelation ends in failure:
<br>    now secret identity is past;
<br>    restore the player;
<br>    now Beauty is passive;
<br>    say "She wrinkles her nose. 'I don't understand!' she says. 'What are you trying to tell me?'
</p>
<p class="quoted">
    You could weep for womankind. But you don't quite dare spell it out in so many words, not when someone might come up the stair and overhear a chance revelation."

</p>
<p class="quoted">
'Not much like you,' you say, glancing over her petite frame and pert nose. 'But female, at any rate.'"

<p>And now, since we don't really want to return to the rest of the 'marriage proposal' scene once she has learned our ID:</p>

Compromise proposal is a scene. Compromise proposal begins when Dramatic Revelation ends in success. When Compromise Proposal begins: now Beauty is passive.

Instead of asking an awake beauty about a topic listed in the Table of Secondary Conversation when Compromise Proposal is happening:

<p>Notice that we moved the re-activation rule down here so that the Compromise Proposal rule would fire first.

<h3>RB §4.6. Plot Management</h3>
<p>A plot manager (sometimes called a drama manager) is a piece of the program whose job it is to plan out events so that, whatever the player does, the story advances and an interesting narrative results. The plot manager might, for instance, decide that the player has wandered around for too many scenes without making any progress, and might compensate by making something happen that gives him a new hint on his current problem. It might trigger characters to act when it thinks the story should be reaching a crisis point. It might introduce new complications when it determines that the player is running out of problems to solve.</p>
<p>This is a theoretically challenging field. Sophisticated plot management requires that the story make difficult guesses, such as whether the player is "stuck" and what the player is working on right now. The advantage of using such a system is that (done very well) it makes the story extremely responsive to the player's behavior, which means that he is a real agent in the unwinding of the plot. It also contributes to the replayability, since trying the story a second or third time will produce quite different outcomes. But it is procedurally difficult to design a good plot management system and it requires a huge amount of content, as well: in order for the plot manager to give the player hints, change the course of events to suit his focus, and so on, the story has to have available many, many more scenes than will ever occur in any single playing.</p>
<p><a href="rb_4.html#example-209" class="example-link" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example-209').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();">Fate Steps In</a><span class="example-difficulty"> ★★★</span> is only a <em>very</em> brief sketch in this direction, one in which the "fate" entity is trying to accomplish an end goal and, every turn, looks for ways to push the story towards that conclusion, whatever the player does.</p>

<p>One of the nice things about before rules for actions is that they allow us to express some planning for characters other than the player: we've already seen how this works, a bit. But we could also use before rules to write plans for an abstract story-driving entity, rather than for other individual characters. This story-driver could be in charge of all the non-player characters, as well as spontaneous or natural changes in the environment, shaping the narrative around the player's behavior.</p>
<p>The following example is a very simple one, but the same concept could be worked out in a great deal more complexity, with all sorts of alternative procedures available to our story-manager:</p>

</p>
<p class="quoted">
Fate is a woman. After deciding the scope of the player: place Fate in scope. The description of Fate is "Not smiling." Instead of doing something other than examining to fate: say "As if."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Every turn: try fate tripping.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Tripping is an action applying to nothing.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Carry out someone tripping:
<br>    if something dangerous (called the trap) is in the location:
<br>        say "Lise chooses this moment to lick her fingers -- it's not gross, it's natural, you decide -- stand up, and head for the door. Unfortunately, her path crosses directly over [the trap]. There is a vaudevillesque moment where you try to warn or catch her; the next moment she's on the floor, looking shocked and also in quite a lot of pain. 'I'm not sure,' she says to you steadily but with unfocused gaze, 'but I think I might have broken my tailbone.'";
<br>        end the story saying "Well, she's paying attention to you now".
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Before someone tripping when the location does not contain a dangerous thing: try the person asked making a mess instead.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Making a mess is an action applying to nothing.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Carry out someone making a mess:
<br>    let calamitous object be a random visible supporter which supports at least three things;
<br>    if calamitous object is a supporter:
<br>        say "[The calamitous object] tips over, spilling [the list of things on calamitous object] all over the place.";
<br>        move the calamitous object to the location;
<br>        now every thing on the calamitous object is in the location.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Definition: a thing is dangerous if it is not the carton and it is not the table and it is not a person.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Before someone making a mess when a safe supporter (called target) is visible:
<br>    if Lise carries something, try Lise putting a random thing carried by Lise on the target instead.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Instead of someone making a mess when the tray is on the table:
<br>    say "Just at that moment, a large blond man-thing in a red jacket walks more or less through you, and you come into violent contact with the table, knocking [the list of the things on the table] onto the floor.";
<br>    now every thing on the table is in the location;
<br>    now every thing on the tray is in the location instead.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Definition: a supporter is safe if the number of things on it is less than two.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
McQuerry Dining Hall is a room.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
The table is scenery in the dining hall. The table is a supporter.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Lise Fitzwallace is a woman in the Dining Hall. "Lise is at the nearest table, not apparently paying any attention to you." The description of Lise is "A capella singer, women's rugby champion, general object of attention from all genders. Unlikely to notice you unless fate smiles broadly." Lise carries a fork, a napkin, an empty glass, and a plate of half-eaten eggplant parmesan.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Report Lise putting something on something:
<br>    say "Lise, still deep in thought, absently puts [the noun] on [the second noun]." instead.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
The carrying capacity of the player is 2. The carton of chocolate milk is in the Hall. "There's a carton of milk beside you, which you set down for a moment -- but you do want it."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Instead of taking something when the player carries the tray:
<br>    say "You've got both hands full with this tray."
</p>
<p class="quoted">
The player carries the tray. On the tray is some macaroni and some overdone chicken. The macaroni and the chicken are edible. The tray is portable.
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Test me with "get milk / put tray on table / get milk".
</p>
<p class="quoted">
Test again with "drop tray".
