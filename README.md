# Standard Rules by Graham Nelson
## Version 3/120430 for [Inform 7](http://inform7.com) 6M62

I didn't know of a convenient place to view this on the web, so I made a [Standard Rules source web page](https://zedlopez.github.io/standard_rules/) with a brief table of contents and links to the Inform 7 documentation as appropriate.

The Standard Rules are available within their natural habitat of Inform 7 packages at the [Inform 7 Downloads](http://inform7.com/downloads/) page.

(In hope of avoiding confusion, note that the Standard Rules for Inform 7's 6L02 and 6L38 releases are also internally labelled Version 3/120430, but each is different from the others.)
